# teachess
At the moment, a chess UI built for educational purposes
# TODO:
- ADD LOGIC TO AI MOVES
- implement some ai, even a little
- implement animations/smoothing over
## ideas
- random opening play
## notes
- no logic to ai moves
- promotion logic wip
- kingcheck logic for ai
- animations maybe? for smoother transitions (look into this).
- sounds? doable
- fen parser for use in image scanning(set up when possible).
- promotions have trouble with redo undo with ai move
