# teachess
At the moment, a chess UI built for educational purposes
# TODO:
- ADD LOGIC TO AI MOVES
- implement some ai, even a little
- implement animations/smoothing over
- openings move finished, now to add table evaluations.
- add palette swap for when playing as black.
- add deep minimax
- add alpha beta pruning
## ideas
- random opening play
## notes
- no logic to ai moves
- promotion logic wip
- kingcheck logic for ai
- animations maybe? for smoother transitions (look into this).
- sounds? doable
- fen parser for use in image scanning(set up when possible).
- promotions have trouble with redo undo with ai move (fixed).
- random move is clunky, implement piece square table.
- keep track of enpassant movement specifically for when the king is checked
- undo/redo tracking.
